# Dynamical Systems in JuliaLang
#### Introduction to JuliaLang guest lecture I did for a computiational physics and complex systems course.

- ##### Discloser: these notebooks were created when I had only 3 months experience with Julia. I do not claim to "know what I am doing" in any professional sense.

#### One file uses Julia's Pluto Notebooks https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl
#### The other is intended for VS Code https://code.visualstudio.com
